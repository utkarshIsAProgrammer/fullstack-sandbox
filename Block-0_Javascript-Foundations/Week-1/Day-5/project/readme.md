## Social Icon Hover Effects

- This is a simple, single-page web project that demonstrates a clean and modern hover effect on social media icons. The goal is to provide a visually appealing and responsive way to display links to various social profiles using only HTML and CSS.

## Features

> Smooth Hover Transition: The icons use CSS transitions to provide a smooth, animated effect when the user's cursor moves over them.

> Color and Scale Change: On hover, the icons change color and slightly increase in size, giving clear visual feedback to the user.

> Fully Responsive: The layout is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring the icons look great on both desktop computers and mobile devices.

> Minimalist Design: The page focuses on the icons themselves, with a clean and simple background to draw attention to the hover effect.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5: For the basic structure of the page.
- CSS3: For all styling, including the transitions and animations.
- Remix Icons: For a scalable, vector-based set of social media icons.
