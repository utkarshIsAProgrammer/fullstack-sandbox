## What makes a template reusable for future projects?

- Clean structure — folders like /src, /tests, /public are already in place
- Pre-configured tools — ESLint, Prettier, Vitest, CI/CD pipelines, all ready to go
- Easy deploy setup — like Vercel or Netlify already wired in
- Solid README — with setup steps, environment info, and how to run things
- PR and issue templates — so collaboration feels smooth and professional
- Release scripts — for auto-generating changelogs or tagging versions
