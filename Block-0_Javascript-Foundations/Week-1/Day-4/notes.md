## - What is the smallest unit worth testing in your current code?

- The smallest unit worth testing in my current code is a pure function that transforms input into output without side effects.

- I realized that testing small, predictable functions early makes debugging later much easier. It also forces me to think about edge cases I might otherwise ignore.
