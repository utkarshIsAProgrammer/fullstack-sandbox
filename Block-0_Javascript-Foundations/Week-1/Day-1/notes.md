## What surprised me about JavaScript compared to HTML or CSS?

- At first I thought HTMl and CSS is the only fun part in web dev but I am completely wrong about that. Actually JavaScript feels more interesting when I used it for the first time.

- Now I feel making things work in real life is more satisfying than making just un-functional designs.
